# Churn-Modelling-Datasets-Analysis-and-Prediction
The project includes extracting the insights from the dataset that's including multiple features &amp; analyzing the basic as well the complex patterns reflecting relationship, that's affecting customer behaviour

# Introduction 
Big size MNCs to small-sized Companies all are serving a wide range of
customers from different streams, domains, age groups, genders & localities.
In such diverse market, customer retention has become a major and
important challenge. Despite having access to large volumes of datasets,
many lack a structured approach to turn that data into actionable insights.

# Prerequisites
Dataset: Customer Churn(1).csv

# Contents
Extracting the insights includes multiple processes:
Preprocessing & Features Engineering
1. 2. Loading Datasets, Checking, Fixing Data Types & Dropping Invalid rows
Tenure Grouping ( such as 1-12 months, 13-24 months & so on)
3. Preprocessing Includes:
Handling Missing Values/ Data Integrity
Data Type Corrections (objtype-numtype enabling quantiative analysis)
Encoding Categorical Features (One-hot encoding)
Feature Scaling ( to remove range bias)
Data Exploration/ Analysis (Univariate & Numerical Analysis
